# Description
A game I made using react + vite! The goal of this project was to use useEffect and get a better understanding of state/react!
Project was made while following along [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card)

## About this game
The goal of this game is to avoid clicking any previously clicked pokemon and correctly click all given pokemon!
There are four modes in this game: easy, medium, hard and endless.

Easy: Try to get all 6 pokemon correctly
Medium: Try to get all 12 pokemon correctly
Hard: Try to get all 18 pokemon correctly
Endless: Get as many pokemon as you can and reach a new high score! (There are 15 pokemon per rotation. 
Pokemon in previous rotations can be clicked in new rotations. There are 3 pokemon end screens in endless try to get the all!)
